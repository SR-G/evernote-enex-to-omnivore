## Principle

Process `.enex` files with the following algorithm - will try to inject all specified entries into Omnivore, with that logic : 
- **if the source URL is still accessible online** (the program checks this), then a "save URL" command will be issued (and Omnivore will collect the content itself on server side)
- **if the source URL is NOT found in the `.enex` file** OR **if it is NOT online anymore**, then a "save Page" command will be triggered with the content saved in the Evernote note

All successfully processed entries are put in a `.cache` file, in order to not be processed if you launch the command again and again. You can manually edit / add / delete from that whole (or wipe the whole file if you want to start over, knowing that it should be stateless : already existing entries should not create duplicates inside Omnivore, thanks to "consistent UUID" built from the URL inside the program)

## Usage

Available commands : 

```bash
evernote

  Flags: 
       --version       Displays the program version string.
    -h --help          Displays help with available flag, subcommand, and positional value parameters.
    -a --api           OMNIVORE APIKey (default: 547e1bcd-c948-4ce1-9a1f-0a8831be4840)
    -u --url           OMNIVORE Graphql HTTP endpoint / URL (optional) (default: https://api-prod.omnivore.app/api/graphql)
    -i --input         Input files, comma separated (like '-i file1.enex,file2.enex')
    -p --preview       Activate preview mode (optional)
    -r --resume-from   ID (hash) of the last valid URL : only the following URL will be processed (optional)
    -s --skip          IDs (hash) to be skipped (like '-s ID1,ID2') (optional)
    -c --count         Number of items to process (optional, default -1) (default: -1)
```

Example : 

```bash
go run . --input resources/Mes\ notes.0.enex --skip "33613733-6465-3435-6565-393639393233,63343733-3538-6266-6461-636431383537" -c 50 --api XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
Notes : 

- `--skip UUID1,UUI2` is useful is there are some entries for which some troubles are happening (too big content for example)
- `--resume-from <UUID>` allows to skip all the entries BEFORE the entry provided with that parameter

## Disclaimer

This is a one shot program that i fully used on my side with great success, but probably not a very polished one : 
- **code is readabable but not really great** ...
- **no binaries are provided** at this time (you need to run it with go)
- **no guarantees that it will work for you** - it worked really fine on my side to migrate ~4000 web saved pages, but you may encounter different corner cases in your own situation (= please do iterative tests, as stated below)
- **it's not designed to be fast** (not multi-threading, no optimizations, ...), but, well, you are probably going to only use it once

## Procedure (how to use this CLI)

1. Create `.enex` files (for example, under Windows, through the official Evernote desktop client installed from the MS Store - select a notebook, use the `...` button and select the `Export notebook` entry - note : it is adviced to split them in 2GB files, as proposed by the Evernote client during the export)
2. (under linux) GIT clone this project : `git clone https://github.com/SR-G/evernote-enex-to-omnivore.git`
3. cd into it `cd evernote-enex-to-omnivore`
4. Put all your `.enex` files in that folder (for example in a `resources/` subfolder)
5. Prepare the go package : `go mod tidy`
6. Create your API key inside Omnivore, per the Omnivore documentation : https://docs.omnivore.app/integrations/api.html (chapter "Getting an API token")
7. Launch the tool once, in preview mode, with only a subset of entries (10 here), to see how it's behaving : `go run . --input resources/Mes\ notes.0.enex --api XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -c 10 --preview`
8. Check the results in the logs ...
9. If everything is fine, launch without the "preview" mode : ``go run . --input resources/Mes\ notes.0.enex --api XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -c 10` 
10. Check in Omnivore that you see your entries (as "Archived" entries)
11. Launch the tool again (see one of the next chapter about rate limiter, also)

## Example of execution

```bash
Only [50] items will be processed before stopping
Files to be processed : resources/Mes notes.0.enex
OMNIVORE URL [https://api-prod.omnivore.app/api/graphql], OMNIVORE APIKey [XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX]
URLs IDs to be skipped : 33613733-6465-3435-6565-393639393233, 63343733-3538-6266-6461-636431383537
Starting to process file [resources/Mes notes.0.enex]

36626237-6364-6230-3838-666364316333 | SKIPPED (skipped ID from .cache previous file) | https://...

(...)
34386562-3763-3964-6635-393735313131 | IMPORT/Evernote | https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2020/09/04/...
  > [INFO] url [https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2020/09/04/...] still accessible, will save as URL
  > [INFO] Correctly saved to Omnivore :  {"data":{"saveUrl":{"url":"...","clientRequestId":"34386562-3763-3964-6635-393735313131"}}}

Stopping, as [50] entries have been processed

===================================================
Total number of items processed : 50
Total number of items processed as URL : 47
Total number of items processed as Article : 3
Total number of errors while saving as URL : 0
Total number of errors while saving as Article : 0
```

## Rate limiter

Keep in mind there is a **rate limiter** on Omnivore, allowing at max 100 requests per minutes. You have to handle this by yourself.

**Solution #1**

Add a small delay inside the `evernote-enex-to-omnivore.go` (like a 1 seconds sleep)

**Solution #2** 

Just batch the command

```bash
while [[ true ]] ; do
  go run . ... -c 90 
  sleep 60
done
```

And break the script once everything has been processed

**Solution #3** 

There is now a 50 seconds delay inside the script (each 100 entries), so you can also launch it in "infinite mode" (`-c 2000`, `-c -1`, or not defining that parameter at all) and it should be OK (provided Omnivore doesn't change the rate limiter values over time - be careful about that).

## Documentations

Relevant extract from GraphQL Omnivore schema : 

```
  enum ArticleSavingRequestStatus {

    ARCHIVED
  }

  type Label {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    color: String!
    description: String
    createdAt: Date
    position: Int
    internal: Boolean
  }

  input CreateLabelInput {
    name: String! @sanitize(maxLength: 64)
    color: String @sanitize(pattern: "^#([A-Fa-f0-9]{6}|[A-Fa-f0-9]{3})$")
    description: String @sanitize(maxLength: 100)
  }

  input SaveUrlInput {
    url: String!
    source: String!
    clientRequestId: ID!
    state: ArticleSavingRequestStatus
    labels: [CreateLabelInput!]
    locale: String
    timezone: String

```

```json
{id: "1a548f08-70e4-11ee-a5dd-37c570b5ca9f", name: "IMPORT/Evernote", color: "#00D084",â€¦}
